<b>Lua RayCast3D</b>

Lua RayCast3D is a 3D Game Engine for Nintendo 3DS which runs under Lua Player Plus 3DS (lpp-3ds).<br>
It uses Ray-Casting algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) to generate a 3D world starting from a 2D map.<br>
It runs fullspeed on N3DS withtout any accuracy value but runs smooth on O3DS only with accuracy values >= 3.<br><br>

At the moment these are the <b>Features</b> Lua RayCast3D offers:<br>
- Different tile size maps
- Automated camera and player position management
- Support for huge maps (pratically there aren't limitations)
- Support for sky rendering and floor rendering
- Automated minimap renderer with player position
- Textured walls support
- Editable FOV
- Walls collision

What this engine needs to be finished is listed in this <b>TODO List</b>:<br>
- Sprites support for animations
- Bullets physic
- Support to textures for sky, floors
